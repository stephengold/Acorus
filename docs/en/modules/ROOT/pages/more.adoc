{url-examples}/TestAcorusDemo.java[TestAcorusDemo] is a test application
that demonstrates more built-in features of `AcorusDemo`:

* display text on a solid background using an _overlay_
* add world axes to a scene and toggle their visibility
* pause animations without disabling camera motion
* scale a model to a specified height
* position a model so it rests on the X-Z plane,
  with its center on the Y axis
* select among `String` values, as in a menu
* store materials in a "library" and retrieve them by name


TODO discuss each feature in detail
