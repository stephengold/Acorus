= How to add Acorus to an existing project
:Project: Acorus

This is the start page of a web tutorial
about xref:overview.adoc[the Acorus library].

TIP: If you're creating a JMonkeyEngine desktop application from scratch,
https://github.com/stephengold/BasicGame-on-Gradle[the BasicGame-on-Gradle project]
provides a good starting point.

Adding {Project} to an existing JMonkeyEngine project is a 3-step process:

* Add libraries to the classpath.
* Convert the application to an `ActionApplication` or `AcorusDemo`.
* Test and tune as necessary.


== Add libraries to the classpath

{Project} comes pre-built as a JVM library that depends on:

* jme3-core,
* jme3-desktop, and
* https://github.com/stephengold/Heart[the Heart library].

For projects built using Gradle or Maven, it's usually sufficient to specify the
dependency on the {Project} Library.  Build tools should automatically
resolve the remaining dependencies.

=== Gradle-built projects

Add to the project's "build.gradle" or "build.gradle.kts" file:

[source,groovy]
----
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.stephengold:Acorus:2.0.0")
}
----

For some older versions of Gradle,
it's necessary to replace `implementation` with `compile`.

=== Maven-built projects

Add to the project's "pom.xml" file:

[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
    <repository>
      <id>mvnrepository</id>
      <url>https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.stephengold</groupId>
  <artifactId>Acorus</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
----

=== Ant-built projects

https://ant.apache.org[Ant] doesn't know about transitive dependencies,
so you'll need to resolve them manually.

Download the {Project} library and its dependencies
from GitHub and/or Maven Central:

* https://github.com/stephengold/Acorus/releases/latest
* https://github.com/stephengold/Heart/releases/tag/9.0.0
* https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/jmonkeyengine/jme3-core/3.6.1-stable/
* https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/jmonkeyengine/jme3-desktop/3.6.1-stable/

You'll definitely want the class JARs
and probably the "-sources" and "-javadoc" JARs as well.

Open the project's properties in the IDE (JME SDK or NetBeans):

. Right-click on the project (not its assets) in the "Projects" window.
. Select menu:Properties[] to open the "Project Properties" dialog.
. Under "Categories:", click on btn:[Libraries].
. Click on the btn:[Compile] tab.
. Add the Acorus class JAR:
.. Click on the btn:[Add JAR/Folder] button.
.. Navigate to the download directory.
.. Select the "Acorus-2.0.0.jar" file.
.. Click on the btn:[Open] button.
. (optional) Add JARs for javadoc and sources:
.. Click on the btn:[Edit] button.
.. Click on the btn:[Browse...] button to the right of "Javadoc:"
.. Select the "Acorus-2.0.0-javadoc.jar" file.
.. Click on the btn:[Open] button.
.. Click on the btn:[Browse...] button to the right of "Sources:"
.. Select the "Acorus-2.0.0-sources.jar" file.
.. Click on the btn:[Open] button button again.
.. Click on the btn:[OK] button to close the "Edit Jar Reference" dialog.
. Add the other JVM libraries in a similar manner.
. Click on the btn:[OK] button to exit the "Project Properties" dialog.


== Convert to an `ActionApplication`

JMonkeyEngine applications typically extend the `SimpleApplication` class.
To use Acorus, an application should instead
extend `ActionApplication` or one of its subclasses, typically `AcorusDemo`.

* `ActionApplication` and `AcorusDemo` are both abstract classes.
* `ActionApplication` is simpler and easier to understand.
* `AcorusDemo` extends `ActionApplication` with features intended for demo apps.

`ActionApplication` directly extends `SimpleApplication`
and has a similar interface (API).
The key difference is that startup code goes in a `acorusInit()` method
instead of `simpleInitApp()`.

[NOTE]
====
`AcorusDemo` implements `acorusInit()`.
If your application extends `AcorusDemo`,
it should should always invoke `super.acorusInit()`.
====


== Summary

* Acorus is available as a pre-built library.
* Apps should extend `AcorusDemo` or maybe `ActionApplication`.
* Startup code goes in `acorusInit()`, not `simpleInitApp()`.
