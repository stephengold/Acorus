= How to build Acorus from source
:Project: Acorus

{Project} is free, open-source software.

While pre-built artifacts
can be downloaded from GitHub and the Maven Central Repository,
some people prefer to build them from source.

You can also build a local copy of the documentation (website content).
This is useful if you are editing the content,
or if your Internet access is limited or unreliable.


== Library artifacts

=== Standard build

Here's the recommended procedure:

. Install a https://adoptium.net/releases.html[Java Development Kit (JDK)],
  version 17 or higher,
  if you don't already have one.
. Point the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to your JDK installation:
  (The path might be something like "C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.3.7-hotspot"
  or "usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64/" or
  "/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/liberica-jdk-17-full.jdk/Contents/Home" .)
.. using Bash or Zsh: `export JAVA_HOME="` *path to installation* `"`
.. using Fish: `set -g JAVA_HOME "` *path to installation* `"`
.. using Windows Command Prompt: `set JAVA_HOME="` *path to installation* `"`
.. using PowerShell: `$env:JAVA_HOME = '` *path to installation* `'`
. Download and extract the {Project} source code from GitHub:
.. using Git:
... `git clone https://github.com/stephengold/Acorus.git`
... `cd Acorus`
... `git checkout -b latest 2.0.2`
.. using a web browser:
... browse to https://github.com/stephengold/Acorus/releases/latest
... follow the "Source code (zip)" link
... save the ZIP file
... extract the contents of the saved ZIP file
... `cd` to the extracted directory
. Run the Gradle wrapper to build the entire project:
.. using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew build`
.. using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew build`

After a successful build,
artifacts will be found in the "AcorusLibrary/build/libs" directory.

=== Install artifacts

You can install the built artifacts to your local Maven repository:

* using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew install`
* using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew install`

=== Cleanup

After a build, you can restore the project to a pristine state:

* using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew clean`
* using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew clean`


== Website content

. Download and extract the source code from GitHub:
.. `git clone https://github.com/stephengold/Acorus.git`
.. `cd Acorus`
. Edit "docs/playbook.yml" and replace "/home/sgold/NetBeansProjects/Acorus"
  with an absolute path to your checkout directory (3 places).
. https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/install-and-run-quickstart/#install-nodejs[Install Node.js]
. Install Antora:
.. `npm i -D -E @antora/cli@3.1`
. Run Antora:
.. `npx antora docs/playbook.yml`

After a successful build,
the local copy of the site will be found in the "build/site" directory.
